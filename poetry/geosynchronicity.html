      <p>Icarus touched the sky and dreamed of living there</p><p>He bound the sun in rocket-wings with feathers burning air</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>Icarus tasted space and sanctioned a station high</p><p>Within her swing tried hiding from the ancient mother&#39;s eye</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>Left the calling hunger sung chronically for Love</p><p>Forever falling hung geosyncronally above</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>With borrowed breaths he burrowed to new abyssal deeps</p><p>Scraped sand from tranquility&#39;s shores and took it home to keep</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>Then stars of far-flung cities indicted his apostasy</p><p>Bid him back to ground with the loving arm of gravity -</p><p>What once bound him held now his hound of hell</p><p>It was not the sun that killed him but his plunge into the sea</p></p><p>
