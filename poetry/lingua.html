      <p>Infinital signature encrypted into digital by hands with ten fingers,</p><p>Dimensional arrays translated or serialized will always linger</p><p>In the format familiar as language:</p><p>Meaning&#39;s magic manifests sounds agreed upon as scratches, left forward on clay tablets, on papers, on spinning disks like bits of the supernature</p><p>One meaning woven through every word,</p><p>One translation for every tongue,</p><p>One language for every lingua:</p><p>the letters drawn by lines between the stars say the same as the words between the lines say the same as the lives lived on branching lines all linking back to the source of all sound, to the root of all words:</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>silence</p></p><p>
