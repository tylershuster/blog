      <h1>The Death of the Water Drinker</h1>
      
      <p>He came to me in wintertime;</p><p>the snow fell softly down.</p><p>The birds had ceased their warbled songs;</p><p>a restless peace had grown.</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>He told me of his people&#39;s past</p><p>and what they&#39;d come to be.</p><p>I told him of their future paths -</p><p>the things they&#39;d come to see.</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>I sung to him of dyings when</p><p>the beasts would run no more.</p><p>I sung to him of warring times,</p><p>when brothers&#39;d come ashore.</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>He heard my words with rapt attent.</p><p>He drank his water slow</p><p>and as I spoke, his tears awoke</p><p>and fell like Winter&#39;s snow.</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>The land would die, I said to him:</p><p>he&#39;d live in shacks of stone.</p><p>The buffalo had passed away</p><p>in stead a web was woven</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>His friends would shrink to few</p><p>And they&#39;d live in borrowed tombs</p><p>A specter of their glory</p><p>Their children dead in wombs.</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>His heart all fell to ashes</p><p>His face took somber hue</p><p>He begged to me for mercy</p><p>but nothing could I do.</p></p><p><hr></p><p><p>He wrote my words, the wise to see</p><p>That they might stem the tide</p><p>And as a knell he sorry fell</p><p>The water drinker died.</p></p><p>
